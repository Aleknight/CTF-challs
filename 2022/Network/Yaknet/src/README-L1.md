## Description to put on CTFd
YET ANOTHER Karst Net

We developed Yet Another awesome game for people to get lost during GreHack.
You fell in a labyrinth, I heard rumors that there is a flag somewhere.
Find the flag or else you will never see the sunlight again.

The labyrinth now has holes, you cannot jump over them.
I think this level is impossible, you will never get to my flag.
