YET ANOTHER Karst Net

We developed Yet Another awesome game for people to get lost during GreHack.
You fell in a labyrinth, I heard rumors that there is a flag somewhere.
Find the flag or else you will never see the sunlight again.

This labyrinth is huge and not completed, anyway go find the flag.
One does not simply walk into the flag.
You will not be able to explore every corners of this labyrinth by walking.
