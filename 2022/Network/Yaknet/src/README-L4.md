## Description to put on CTFd
YET ANOTHER Karst Net

We developed Yet Another awesome game for people to get lost during GreHack.
You fell in a labyrinth, I heard rumors that there is a flag somewhere.
Find the flag or else you will never see the sunlight again.

This level is very very big, a human should be able to find the flag, probably not a sane human.
No hacks allowed here.
