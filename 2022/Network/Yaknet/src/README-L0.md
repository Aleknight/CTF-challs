## Description to put on CTFd
YET ANOTHER Karst Net

We developed Yet Another awesome game for people to get lost during GreHack.
You fell in a labyrinth, I heard rumors that there is a flag somewhere.
Find the flag or else you will never see the sunlight again.

This is the first level of the series, test your setup and get the game properly working.
You will need the lib SDL2 to run this game.
